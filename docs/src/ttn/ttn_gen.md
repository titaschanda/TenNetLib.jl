# Generating `TTN`

TeNLib.jl defines following functions to generate TTNs with random entries.

For the standard TTN with the default hierarchical binary tree structure, follwoing function can
be used.
```@docs
default_randomTTN
```

The underlying default binary tree for the function above is generated by the following function.

```@docs
default_graph_sitenodes(N::Int)
```

In the generic scenario, a random TTN with user-defined structure can be generated by the following function.

```@docs
randomTTN
```

!!! info
    The above function can be used to generate any loop-free tensor network.
